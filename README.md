## Create your zsh xxh plugin

1. Fork this repo
2. Edit the plugin files:
    * `pluginrc.zsh` - this script will be executed on the host when you connect to the host. Put here your functions,
      environment variables, aliases and whatever you need.
    * `build.sh` - this script should be executed to prepare the plugin on local xxh. It will be executed automatically
      if `build` directory is not exists.
    * `env` - see description below
3. Replace this list to description of your xxh plugin (review other xxh plugins)
4. Push your commits and rename your repo to `xxh-plugin-zsh-yourtitle`
5. Install the plugin to your xxh home:

### What this plugin does

Allows you to use your fast plugin manager antidote on a remote host

With this simple plugin for xxh-plugin-zsh your `$HOME/.zsh_plugins.txt` will be copied to a remote host and sourced by
xxh-shell-zsh. and allow for your [antidote](https://github.com/mattmc3/antidote) plugins to be loaded on the remote host. 
if you have to configure a plugin in `.zshrc` its probably not a
good to put the plugin in the `$HOME/.zsh_plugins.txt` file.

example `.zsh_plugins.txt`:

```angular2html

romkatv/zsh-defer kind:clone 

ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh path:lib

zpm-zsh/ls

zpm-zsh/undollar

```

6. Try connect in update mode: `xxh [user@]host[:port] +s zsh +if`

## `env` file

The xxh has seamless environment mode which allows to pass variable from your current shell session
to the xxh host session. For example if you have `ZSH_THEME` variable with your shell color theme you shouldn't
worry about passing it manually. Add it to `env` file (one variable name per line) and you can do the magic by
using `source xxh.zsh` command:

```
home> echo $ZSH_THEME
agnoster
home> source xxh.zsh myhost
myhost> echo $ZSH_THEME
agnoster
``` 

This very useful when you want to use the same tools on your local and remote host.
